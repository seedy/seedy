I don't know what I would do without music, festivals, parties. Cooking in festivals is also meeting new people, spending time as a group and help each other during rush hours.<br/>Practicing a weather-dependent activity teaches patience and commitment.<br/>All those outdoor activities are a mean to balance my everyday life and enjoy coming home and my desktop routine.<br/><br/>I'd like to <bold>share</bold> some memories with you, if you wish.",
