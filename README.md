# 👋 Welcome to my presentation, I'm Cedric

Hey there! Happy to have your interest.

I'm a passionate Frontend engineer, with strong experiences on **React**, **Javascript** and **UI/UX**.

I work on employee contracts, fully remote.

I live about 1h away from Lyon, France, in a village called Ranchal.

- 🥾 I love travels and hikes, yikes!
- ⛺ I'm always up for a wild camping trip
- 🚐 I recently converted my car to sleep inside it 
- 🎧🔊 Music sets my soul on 🔥
- 🎪 I love festivals, particularly sound system culture
- I volunteer as a cook 🍳, whenever I got time
- 🌱🌻 I grow my own garden at home, with vegetables, flowers, aromatic and medicinal plants
- 🏄🏂 I'm into surfing and snowboarding, but I love most outdoor activities
